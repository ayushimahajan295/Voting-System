# Full Stack Web App to DApp Conversion

## Problem Statement
The challenge is to take an existing full-stack voting web app and transform it into a decentralized application (DApp) using blockchain technology. The goal is to elevate the voting process by implementing smart contracts that ensure top-notch security and create a smooth, user-friendly experience. Think outside the box and explore how you can implement more advanced voting methods that capture votes in a deeper, more meaningful way.

Additionally, you must ensure voter anonymity while maintaining the election system’s security and transparency, so no votes are compromised. The challenge is to balance protecting voter privacy with ensuring the election’s integrity.

## Evaluation Criteria

| **Criteria**                                            | **Points** | **Description**                                                                                                                                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Conversion to a DApp**                          | 1-2        | Convert the existing voting web app into a DApp using basic smart contracts to handle vote submission and tallying.                                      |
| **Smart Contract Optimization**                         | 2-3        | Optimize smart contracts for efficiency (e.g., gas costs) or use an alternative consensus mechanism for vote validation.                                  |
| **Alternative Voting Mechanism**                        | 2-3        | Implement a more sophisticated or creative method for determining the winner, beyond a simple majority system. Allow voters to express nuanced preferences. |
| **Enhanced User Experience (UX)**                       | 1-2        | Improve the UI/UX for a more intuitive and accessible voting experience.                                                                                 |
| **Security Enhancements**                               | 1-2        | Add security measures to prevent double voting, ensure secure authentication, or audit transaction history.                                               |
| **Anonymous Identity Without Compromising Integrity**    | 3          | Develop a way for voters to maintain their privacy and anonymity while ensuring the system remains tamper-proof and fully auditable.                        |

## Requirements
1. **Blockchain & Smart Contracts:** Use blockchain technology to handle voting and results with smart contracts.
2. **User Privacy & Security:** Ensure anonymity and security of user votes while maintaining election integrity.
3. **Advanced Voting Mechanisms:** Incorporate creative voting methods beyond majority rule (e.g., rank-choice voting or weighted votes).
4. **Optimization:** Optimize smart contracts for minimal gas consumption or explore consensus mechanism alternatives.
